    <h1>Chess Variation</h1>
    <p>
        Here's the rules:
    <ul>
        <li>As in standard chess, white moves first.</li>
        <li>The first player to move their king onto row 8 is the winner.</li>
        <li>Pieces move and capture the same as in standard chess.</li>
        <li>As in standard chess, a player is not allowed to expose their own king to check (including moving a piece
            that was blocking a check such that it no longer does).</li>
        <li>Unlike standard chess, a player is not allowed to put the opponent's king in check (including moving a piece
            that was blocking a check such that it no longer does).</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Game:
    <ul>
        <li>Current turn:
            <span id="turn">White</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Game state: <span id="state">UNFINISHED</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
